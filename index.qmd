**As a biologist at the Science Park of the University of Amsterdam, it’s likely that you will generate large amounts of data. The Biological Data Science Center (bioDSC) was initiated to help you analyse that data.**

Our aim is to enable you to perform analyses yourself, which is why we offer workshops, on-line tutorials and in-person mentoring. We have an open-door policy: we encourage you to send an email or drop by one of our desks when you need help or input with your data analysis problem. For quick questions, check out our Slack channel!

## Our approach

::: {.g-col-9}

The bioDSC was initiated in September ’24, and we are currently finding out what works best to optimally support people with their data analyses.

Our core members are embedded in several research groups at the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (SILS), to be integrated in the community of researchers at Science Park. In addition, other researchers at SILS sometimes volunteer to further support data analyses and good practices.

## Check out our online resources

Check out our blog for quick reads on coding, which maybe inspiring for your research. Check out our tutorials for full protocols on analyses that are often performed by biologists at the UvA Science Park, such as RNA-seq.

## Check out our workshops

Our aim is to organize workshops on topics researchers are interested in and that will help them. We’re currently working on composing a list of workshops and will start to organize them soon. Check out our workshop page to see whether we already have a workshop that is of interest to you. If you’re interested in a topic that’s not on the list, don’t hesitate to send us an email or drop by. We can either help you out with your specific problem, or organize a workshop if it’s a topic of potential interest to many researchers.

## History

At the University of Amsterdam Science Park, enthusiastic researchers started the Science Park Study Group in 2017. The idea was to create a local culture of connecting and sharing knowledge with regard to coding in the biological sciences. Having started in September ’24 with the bioDSC, we aim to further boast this initiative and spirit.
