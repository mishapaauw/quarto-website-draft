The Biological Data Science Center (bioDSC) was created to help you analyse that data.\nOur aim is to enable you to perform analyses yourself, which is why we offer workshops, on-line tutorials and in-person mentoring. We have an open-door policy: we encourage you to send an email or drop by one of our desks when you want help or input with your data analysis problem. For quick questions, check out our Slack channel!\nSend an email Drop by Slack"

It might not develop into a full tutorial or protocol, but instead of keeping it to ourselves, we will share it here on this blog. Who knows, maybe it’s useful for someone in the future!\nTopics we aim to cover:\n\nBioinformatics, from RNA-seq to comparative genomics and anything beyond that\nData visualization, focussing on the ggplot universe in R\nCrunchomics, tips and tricks to use the high-performance compute cluster of the University of Amsterdam\nData management and archiving\n\nDo not hesitate to send us an email if you have ideas for new topics, or if you want to contribute to the blog by co-authoring a post!"

In addition, other researchers at SILS sometimes volunteer to further support data analyses and good practices."

If you’re interested in a topic that’s not on the list, don’t hesitate to send us an email or drop by.
